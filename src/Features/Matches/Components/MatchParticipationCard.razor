@* TODO: Improve looks and addd functionality *@
@*
- Make it look like a Deck card
  - Show the player in some nice way (large avatar?)
  - Have an action footer with "Change deck" and "Edit deck" actions (maybe the regular footer is not needed?)
- The card should be interactive after the match has started
  - Clicking on the card opens a dialog where the user can choose what happened (the player has won/lost)
